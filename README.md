Showcase Details

Purpose

This task is designed to showcase your skills in web development, your ability to create a user-friendly and informative UI, and the organization and structure of code you write from scratch. This problem is left intentionally vague and open-ended in many regards because at Scope Labs, you will not always be given exact, precise, and detailed specifications for the functionality you will be implementing. You will often be responsible for making reasonable design decisions, and determining the precise spec for your work.

The Problem

You are a software engineer, and have been hired by an EdTech company to develop a simple web application that allows users to create, comment on, and watch educational videos. The application should interact with the given backend API and provide a seamless and engaging experience for users. The design and UI are up to you to create.

Requirements

Platform and Technology: Please use React or Next.js as the primary frontend framework for your submission.

User Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface, considering the educational context. Adding a splash page for the platform is not a requirement but a nice addition.

API Integration: We have set up a very basic server with documentation. Please use your first and last name snake case as your user_id for creating video objects (e.g. John Smith: john_smith). You may use any fake user_id you would like when making comments, and you can upload any example video URLs.

App Functionality: The website must have the following capabilities:

-- Show a list of videos and allow users to select a video from the list.

-- Allow the user to create a new video object with a title, description and a video URL.

-- A user must be able to comment on a video and view comments from other users.

-- Open the videos in full screen with full playback functionality.

-- Include options for adjusting playback speed and volume.

The Solution

The above problem statement outlines the general functionalities that the application must be able to handle, but intentionally does not provide specifications - those specifications, as well as general system design and organization, are up to you. An ideal solution will follow best practices for componentization and state management, be well-organized, well-documented/commented and easy to understand by other engineers.

Please upload your solution to GitHub and submit the link here. Include a README in the submitted repository with the following:

-- An overview of your solution and its features.

-- Instructions on how to build and run the application on the web.

-- Screenshots of the platform.

-- Any other necessary information to test the application.

Submitting a Loom video explaining your approach to the problem is optional but a nice to have. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to cory@scopelabs.com

Happy building!
